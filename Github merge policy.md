Target:
	- Smooth traceability for old version of code

Each person must follow the policy:
* In your branch, when you commit:
	- New model for new task: "Create model"
	- Fix something in your model: "Fix feature Model_name"
- When you commit for pull merge request:
	- New model merge: "Create model Model_name"
	- Fix something in your model: "Fix feature Model_name"
		- For better traceability, you can write the test case that you findout error and how ensure it is working
